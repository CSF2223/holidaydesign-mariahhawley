                <h4>Christmas Boats</h4>
                <p>Venezuela</p>
                <h3>Christmas trees are popular in Greece, but you’ll also find boats wrapped in strings of lights, whether in the water or in the main square. There are two explanations for the boat-decorating phenomenon: The first is that the country’s ancient maritime tradition means boats have always been an integral part of the culture, so they were decorated long before a modernized version of Christmas (including trees) came along. The second is that St. Nicholas is considered the patron saint of sailors, which is probably why boats are decorated on December 6th.

                <h4>Skating To Mass</h4>
                <p>Venezuela</p>
                <h3>While Australians are surfing, Venezuelans are skating. It’s a long-running holiday tradition for the entire capital city of Caracas to roller skate to early morning mass on Christmas Day. In fact, vehicles are banned from many parts of the city before 8 a.m. In case this form of transportation isn’t strange enough, the night before kids will tie one end of a string to their big toe and hang the other end out of their bedroom window, so passing roller skaters can give the string a friendly tug on their way to mass the next morning.

                <h4>Three Kings Day</h4>
                <p>Venezuela</p>
                <h3>On January 6, Three Kings’ Day is celebrated in much of the Spanish-speaking world, marking the occasion when three wise men visited the baby Jesus on the twelfth day of Christmas, bringing gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. In Spain, Dia de los Reyes, as it’s known, is all about massive parades and roscon de reyes, a sweet, ring-shaped pastry meant to resemble a king’s crown. The pastry traditionally contains a small plastic figure, granting the finder royal status for the day. The pastry also conceals a bean, burdening the finder with the task of buying next year’s cake.
